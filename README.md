#Design process 

##Mood board 
![Moodboard](/assets/moodboard.png "Moodboard")
My design is the amalgamation between cyperpunk and scandinavian interior art. I choose scandinavian interior art because I personality think they are very soothing and calming to look at and cyberpunk to add my personality to the design itself. 

##Personal logo 
![Logo](sukianto-suteja-portfolio_files/LogoMakr_0AGPcd.png "Logo")
This logo is heavily insipred by Nintendo Switch's logo, I realise that nintendo switch logo relies on the similarity of their controller as their logo and used negative space and color to shows that their similarity is what makes them unique. Both of my first name and last name starts with an "S" and that's how i came up with this logo. 

The tool that i used to create this logo:

#Project management 

![Trello](assets\trello.JPG "Trello-board")
Initially, I prioritized the product itself and planned to create the mock-up after. Throughout the development cycles, I realised that I often redesign the product on the development environment. Therefore, I tried to mock my product first and work on it after i decided on the design. My workflow was completely changed after that. 

#Short questions

#####Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)

In 1980s, internet was very slow becaused it relied on the existing infrastucture that was not made for the internet. Internet used telephone line to transfer data and we have to use cable to connect the telephone line to the computer. 
Now, we have created infrastructure specifically for the internet such as fiber optics to support high-speed internet. Wireless connection was invented, now we do not need to connect our computer to the telephone line to connect to the internet. 

#####Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

Domain is the name used to identify IP addresses.
e.g: 
Facebook: www.facebook.com 
"facebook" is the domain name, there are many other IP under the facebook domain, the domain is simply adding more specificity to the seaching process and makes the searching process faster. 

#####Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

On the aspect of opportunity, the development of the internet technologies opens up an unlimited force of supply and demand for everyone. Countless number of services are created because of the internet, such as:

* Online shopping 
* Online video streaming
* Online news
* etc.. 

All of these are created because of the development of the internet. Some people even made their career fully based on the internet.
