        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Here's a few highlight of my life that lead me to pursue a career in development. 
        </p>
        <div class="timeline">
            <h1>
                Failed 5th Grade 
            </h1>
            <p>
                I used to hate going to school and studying in general, because I didn't have any motivation and purpose to put a lot of effort into my study. I failed 5th grade and I saw the dissapointment on my parents face and it became my motivation to keep those kind of faces out of my parents. 
            </p>

        <div class="timeline">
            <h1>
                Tried Visual Basic 
            </h1>
            <p>
                There was a Visual Basic extracurricular on my highschool and out of curiousity I applied and happened to enjoyed it very much but I never thought that will pursue programming as my career.

            <h1>
                Choosing Computer Study Over Law 
            </h1>
            <p>
                My mindset was pretty much the same since, I failed 5th grade and I did a research to find  the most respectable field of study in order make my parents proud. Until my parents sat me down and talked me through, they changed my mindset and I decided to pursue a career or study with my well-being as the priority.

            <h1>
                Bachelor's degree in Computer Science 
            </h1>
            <p>
                I have mixed feeling towards my study in University. I enjoyed the study but, it was a bit too theoretical and it didn't provide me with enough practical experience. Generally, it was a fruitful experience but it wasn't enough for me.

                I'm seeking the practical experience that I'm lacking and currently I'm studying web development in CoderAcademy.
